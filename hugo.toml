Welcome to my piano learning diary! I'm 35 years old with zero piano experience, but my love for Toby Fox's music (Undertale, Deltarune) has inspired me to learn.

My goal is to, by the end of 2026, play at least two Toby Fox compositions competently. My number one dream is to one day be able to play [_The World Revolving_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makn7SBdtuU).

Will I succeed? Let us find out together in this very boring diary which I use as a public accountability mechanism to shame myself if I fail or slack off, and where my foibles will be on full display! Also it will be really, really boring! Why would anyone read this?

Enjoy?

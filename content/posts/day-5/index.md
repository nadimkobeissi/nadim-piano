_Jingle Bells_ is seriously such a challenge for me (see [yesterday](../day-4) for context):

![](../day-4/jingle-bells.png)

I've been practicing it like a madman today. Playing this thing correctly while (1) using both hands (2) reading the notes (3) not making any mistakes (4) following the correct tempo and rhythm is so hard that it's making me sweat. Yes, I know it's just _Jingle Bells_, but the truth is that I am finding the correct execution of this exercise incredibly challenging. I can plainly see that learning the piano such that I'm skilled enough to play my [dream songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=makn7SBdtuU) is going to be among the most difficult challenges of my whole life and will certainly require maybe 5+ whole years of dedication. This stuff is really hard!

The good news is that I get it right most of the time, but sometimes I still pause or make mistakes. I want to keep repeating this exercise until I'm fully comfortable.

This is it for today. More _Jingle Bells_. Hopefully, within a few days, I'll be confident enough of my mastery of this exercise to move onto something else, but right now, this exercise is teaching me so many important things (hand coordination, basic notes reading, etc.) that I don't think I should skip over it until I find it positively easy.

Who knew _Jingle Bells_ could be so excruiciating and intimidating!
